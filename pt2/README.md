For the API we created to represent Objects, we store each Object's hash value as a long unsigned int since standard libraries (and thus size_t) are prohibited. The methods that all Objects should have are equals, hash, and hash_me, where hash_me is just a way to generate a hash code for the Object should it be needed. 

Our Queue class implements the Object class and contains one field, which is the array of Object data that is queued. It can enqueue an Object, or add an item to its queue of data. It can dequeue an Object, or remove the head item from its queue of data and return it accordingly. It has a method to print out the queue size so we know how many items are in the queue currently. It has a method to print out the contents of the queue so we know what items are in the queue currently.
